===||=> Double tap on next leading to overlapping double com-report-form

===||=> Download of stored entries from DB on commodities not showing on the first element immediately after page load but on nav back < it shows.

===!=> Editing and deleting
===!=> Make sure that Oga stays on top.
===!=> Sorting of role levels in admin display

===!!!=> Deleting of stored entries in db.report for commodities set as not available just in case values have been stored in db before  <=!!!===
